I quit my job couple months ago, and now I have a lot of free time in my hand. Usually when I'm going through an unemployed phase, I build any app using a meta framework that I never used before. But this time I've decided to change it. The reason behind this is in my days as a programmer I haven't built anything that only uses a programming libraries' standard library. I always use some meta framework.

\
I came to this decision because when I think about everything I've worked on so far I can't help but get the feeling that **I am a SOYDEV**. I've built apps using *MERN stack*, *NextJS*, *Flutter*, *React Native* and *Android*. And I never cared for how they work under the hood. I fit the description. This is not the only reason. I want to be a programmer who is better than most. And I can't get there if I continue doing this.

\
So I've decided to implement a CLI app that has basic functionalities of *Git* with *Golang*. I chose git because a lot of people said its a good way to learn some low level concept and its about time that I learned how it actually works. I picked Go because I like it and would love to learn more.

\
I've already started the project you can view it [here](https://github.com/f1-surya/git-go). Its been fun so far and I'll write about my experience and challenges from it.

Catch you in the next one.
