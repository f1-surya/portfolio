In my previous [blog](https://balasurya.vercel.app/blogs/go-or-java) I ranted
about how I can't decide which language to use for my next project. After some
thought I've decided on Java and Spring Boot.  
<br />
My primary goal right now is to land a job. And from what I've heard, Java is
widely used. I know there are plenty of other developers who also know Java,
but I still believe Java will be a better shot. Plus Java's ecosystem is more
mature and bigger than Go's. So if I run into any issues, I can find a solution
quickly. And more libraries to pick from. Unlike Go I'm already familiar with
Java. So I can spend my time learning the framework instead of the language.  
<br />
I'm really excited about this and can't wait to begin. I'll keep you posted on
the things I learn from this project.  
<br />
Catch you in the next one.
