Before I begin, I want to make sure that I'm not recommending you to use either Go or Java. I'm simply going to rant about how I can't decide which one I should use.

\
2 years ago I wanted to create an app to put on my portfolio. This was during the early stages of my journey as a programmer.
For this app's idea, I decided to create a clone of Twitter. For the tech-stack I chose **Django** for the backend, **Postgres** for DB and **React** for the frontend.
I could've used the built-in template support of Django for frontend but I wanted
to show off my React skills. So I used Create-React-App. I didn't have any prior experience in web development, so it was confusing and tough at times.

\
I didn't have much trouble with the frontend except the CSS(I wish I heard about tailwind back then).
And I struggled with the backend. Especially with designing the models. And it
being well structured and strict didn't help the noob me. But after some time I got it working(Only the basic functionalities).
But when I look back at the code after some years, I feel so dumb and want to improve it.

\
I could just improve the existing code and be done with it, but my interests and tech-stack have been shifted a lot since then.
Originally I wrote the frontend and the backend separately but now I want to build a full-stack application.
And I can't choose between **Java** with **Spring-boot** and **Golang** with **Gin**.

\
Right now I'm unemployed and whichever stack I pick, will decide my stack of expertise.

\
I like Java and I know that might sound insane to some people, but I haven't worked with it much.
I've developed a few **Android** apps with it and used it on **Leetcode**. Maybe if I used it
for a few years, I might also hate it. But until then I like Java and I would love to work with it.

\
I also like Go. I haven't worked with it much but I've heard a lot of good things about it
and I find it intuitive.

\
Both of these stacks are solid choices and have equal amount of pros and cons.
Java has a bigger ecosystem than Go and there more are job postings for Java developers.
But lot of people know Java.

\
Go on the other hand is new compared to Java but rapidly rising in popularity.
The lack of Objects does seem weird to me since I've only worked with Object Oriented languages.
And it has less job opportunities. But it seems fun and has wide application.

\
I think I might pick Java. I've been going through Spring's documentations and it seems very interesting.
Also I'm more familiar with Java than Go. I'm not sure yet but I'll let you know once I decide.

\
Maybe I should try to build the same app in both stacks.

\
Catch you in the next one.
