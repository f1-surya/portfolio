Last month I said that I'll write blogs on a regular basis. But I haven't,
because I got a job. A co-founder of the previous company that I worked at reached out and asked me to work
at his new startup. It is a full-stack developer position and the pay is okay. I've been building an app from scratch using *NextJS* and *Firebase*. In a previous blog 
I said I wanted work with either **Go** or **Java** but due to the state the IT
industry is in now, so I can't be picky.
<br />
<br />
But still, I'm having a lot of fun. I like facing new challenges, learning new stuff. And this is a good way to do that.
<br />
<br />
Anyways, that's all I have to say for now. Catch you in the next one.
